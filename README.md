# Fusion

## Project Overview

Fusion is a web platform designed to address the challenges university students face in connecting with classmates and forming study groups. Unlike traditional social media platforms, Fusion is course-specific, enabling students to join dedicated groups, interact directly with peers, and build meaningful academic relationships. This platform not only fosters collaboration but also provides access to valuable course materials and resources.

## Problem Statement

University students often struggle to find course-specific academic support. Social media platforms fail to offer a centralized system where students can connect with peers in their classes, leading to isolation and missed opportunities for academic collaboration. Fusion bridges this gap by providing a platform tailored to studentsâ€™ academic and social needs, enhancing their overall university experience.
